/// Standard block size representation for file system operations.
///
/// This type represents a 512-byte block, which is the standard sector size
/// for most storage devices. It's used throughout the file system for
/// block-aligned operations and buffer management.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// # extern crate alloc;
/// use file_system::Block;
///
/// let block = Block::default();
/// assert_eq!(block.0.len(), 512);
/// ```
#[repr(transparent)]
pub struct Block(pub [u8; 512]);

impl Default for Block {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Block([0; 512])
    }
}
